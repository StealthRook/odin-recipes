        <p>This quick and easy Brooklyn Style Pizza features a thin crust with a crunchy exterior that
        is loaded up with all of your favorite ingredients. If you are looking for an easy recipe that
        doesn’t require a lot of work or energy then this pizza is for you!</p>

        <p>Brooklyn pizza is most notably characterized by its thin, crunchy crust. By using less
        yeast than other pizza doughs and eliminating any time for the dough to rise, you are able
        to achieve a thin crust that has a crispy exterior and a soft, chewy interior.</p>

        <p>One of our favorite things about this recipe is how simple it is to make! In just about
        30 minutes and with a handful of low cost ingredients you can have a warm, fresh pizza on
        your kitchen table. I like to serve with homemade garlic knots, breadsticks or some type of
        green salad like a Caesar salad or this easy chef salad.</p>

        <p>We love using this pizza dough recipe as a base and setting out a variety of toppings so
        everyone in the family can create their own pizza masterpiece!</p>

        <h2>How to Make Brooklyn Style Pizza</h2>

        <ol>
            <img src="../images/pizza3.jpg" width="300" alt="Step 1">
            <li>Preheat your oven. While the oven is preheating, quickly whisk together the water
            and yeast in a large bowl. Cover the mixture with a dish towel and allow it to sit until
            foamy.</li>

            <img src="../images/pizza4.jpg" width="300" alt="Step 2">
            <li>Stir in the olive oil and salt until homogenous with the foamy yeast. gently whisk
            in the flour until it is fully incorporated and the dough begins to pull away from the
            side of the bowl.</li>
            
            <img src="../images/pizza5.jpg" width="300" alt="Step 3">
            <li>Transfer your pizza dough to a lightly floured surface and knead the dough by hand
            until a cohesive ball forms.</li>

            <img src="../images/pizza6.jpg" width="300" alt="Step 4">
            <li>Roll the ball of dough out into a sheet and lay it on a pizza sheet and top it with
            your marinara sauce, pepperoni, and mozzarella cheese and desired. Cook your pizza until
            the edges are crispy and the cheese is fully melted.</li>

        <h2>How to Store and Reheat Brooklyn Pizza</h2>
        <img src="../images/pizza7.jpg" width="300" alt="Pizza">

        <p>Your leftover pizza can be stored in the fridge for up to 4 days. You can either transfer
        your leftovers to an airtight container or wrap each individual slice in tin foil to prevent
        them from sticking together. When you are ready to reheat your leftovers simply throw a slice
        of pizza in the microwave for about 45 seconds, or until the cheese is hot and bubbly.</p>
